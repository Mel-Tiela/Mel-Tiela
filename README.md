📅 _Monday, January 15, 2018_ : I used the commandline for the first time and that was the beginning of my bitter sweet tech journey  

👩🏾‍💻 Since then, I have played with:  **aws** | **java** | **javaScript** | **node js** | **python** | **html** | **css**
and Spiced it up with : **spring** | **react** | **pandas** 

**So ?**
- I'm much interested in backend development but take delight in coloring my life with some html and css🌈
- I'm currently trying to get better in data structure and algorithmic problems 🤦
